csv-to-json
===========

Convert a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file to [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) with attributes for [Panic Status Board](http://panic.com/statusboard/).

How does it work?
----
`csv-to-json.rb` takes in a file from the web, attemps to convert it to JSON and uploads the file to your Dropbox account with andreafabrizi's [Dropbox-Uploader](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) bash script.
